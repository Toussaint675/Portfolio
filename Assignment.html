</p> 3 years ago, the Detroit Lions changed everything.
They fired GM Bob Quinn and also let go of head coach Matt Patricia. And I wouldn’t be honest with you if I said this era was anything short of a failure.
The Lions went 13-29-1 over two and a half seasons and continued to be the laughingstock of the league. Patricia did nothing to improve the franchise and only kept Lions fans guessing if things were going to get better.
After his firing, the Lions didn’t just start a new era, they revamped the franchise.

</p>First, Lions owner Martha Firestone Ford gave ownership of the team to her daughter Sheila Ford Hamp shortly before Quinn and Patricia’s firing.
Then the Lions hired Brad Holmes for their GM position and Dan Campbell as their next head coach.
Holmes had spent the last 19 years working in public relations and scouting, ultimately being promoted to head of college scouting for the Los Angeles Rams. He was integral in acquiring players like Aaron Donald, Todd Gurley, Cooper Kupp and even his current quarterback, Jared Goff.
He became the GM and immediately started drafting, creating one of the best teams in the league. He drafted players like Amon-ra St. Brown, Penei Sewell, Aidan Hutchinson, Sam LaPorta, Jahmyr Gibbs, Kerby Joesph and Brian Branch. The Lions team you see before you today, was created by Brad Holmes and the front office’s vision.
Head coach Dan Cambell’s journey to the Lions started as a player. Campbell, a tight end for Texas A&M, was selected in the third round and played 10 years including three with the Lions. 

</p>After retirement, he was a tight end coach for the Dolphins for a few years before being hired by the Saints as a tight ends and assistant head coach.
But Campbell’s success goes beyond a former player’s journey. He established a culture, something pertinent to a franchise with no identity. It’s also something a lot of first-time head coaches have problems with. His opening press conference was met with soured reactions. His famous kneecap quote caught the sports world’s attention, leaving reactions of confusion and uncertainty.

</p> </iframe>Campbell’s strength, however, is in his motivation. His ability to motivate any and everyone is something that most coaches lack. The head coaching position is supposed to be a leader of men, someone everyone respects and wants to play for. Sometimes the defining factor in a teams play is the head coach.

</p>Many believed he wouldn’t last long as head coach but his ability to surround himself with great coaches and coordinators has also helped him greatly. Offensive Coordinator Ben Johnson spent the first 9 years of his career both with Boston College and the Miami Dolphins before joining the Lions in 2019. He was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2022 transforming the Lions offense into something franchise altering. His playbook, offensive creativity, and use of every resource has now landed him the Chicago Bears head coaching job.
But the Lions also wouldn’t be anywhere if they not for their defense. Defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, like Campbell, is a former player. 
</p> A cornerback selected in the 1994 draft; Glenn played 14 years in the league for five different franchises. 
After his playing career, Glenn started coaching, first by starting as a personnel scout with the Jets and working his way up to the Saints secondary coach before landing the coordinator spot with the Lions. Glenn’s defensive schemes have led the Lions to a miraculous 16-2 after the team lost 13 defensive players. His ability to make non-starters play beyond their skis is unmatched, landing him multiple head coaching interviews. His schemes and play calling expertise have led him to be credited with being one of the best defensive coordinators after stopping the red-hot Vikings from clinching the #1 seed in the NFC.
But the Lion’s defining move was to trade Matthew Stafford for Jared Goff.

</p> Perhaps the most even trade of all time, the Lions traded Stafford for Goff along with a several picks. The trade created new beginnings for both quarterbacks. Stafford won the super bowl in his first year with the Rams. Goff who had been to a super bowl was traded after Rams head coach, Sean McVay, was unhappy with Goff’s play, specifically his turnovers. 
For Goff, the trade was meant to bury him. The Lions were a suffering franchise with dying game play that only Lions fans watched. But Goff went to work despite his career hit attempt. With gradual growth, Goff has now cemented himself as a top 10 quarterback in the league with outlandish stats.

</p>Despite the heartbreaking Commanders loss in the playoffs, the Lions journey to success can be summed up in a quote by defensive back Amik Robertson.
